# Xendit Coding Exercise

The goal of these exercises are to assess your proficiency in software engineering that is related to the daily work that we do at Xendit. Please follow the instructions below to complete the assessment.

## Setup

1. Fork this repository to your own github profile
2. Ensure `node (>8.6)` and `npm` are installed
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm test`
5. Run `npm start`
6. Hit the server to test health `curl localhost:8010/health` and expect a `200` response 

## Tasks

Below will be your set of tasks to accomplish. Please work on each of these tasks in order. Success criteria will be defined clearly for each task

1. [Documentation](#documentation)
2. [Implement Tooling](#implement-tooling)
3. [Implement Pagination](#implement-pagination)
4. [Refactoring](#refactoring)

### Documentation

Please deliver documentation of the server that clearly explains the goals of this project and clarifies the API response that is expected.

#### Success Criteria

1. A pull request against `master` with a clear description of the change and purpose and merge it
3. **[BONUS]** Create an easy way to deploy and view the documentation in a web format and include instructions to do so

### Implement Tooling

Please implement the following tooling:

1. `eslint` - for linting
2. `nyc` - for code coverage
3. `pre-push` - for git pre push hook running tests

#### Success Criteria

1. Create a pull request against `master` with the new tooling and merge it
    1. `eslint` should have an opinionated format
    2. `nyc` should aim for test coverage of `80%` across lines, statements, and branches
    3. `pre-push` should run the tests before allowing pushing using `git`
2. Ensure that tooling is connected to `npm test`
3. Create a separate pull request against `master` with the linter fixes and merge it
4. Create a separate pull request against `master` to increase code coverage to acceptable thresholds and merge it
5. **[BONUS]** Add integration to CI such as Travis or Circle
6. **[BONUS]** Add Typescript support

### Implement Pagination

Please implement pagination to retrieve pages of the resource `rides`.

1. Create a pull request against `master` with your changes to the `GET /rides` endpoint to support pagination including:
    1. Code changes
    2. Tests
    3. Documentation
2. Merge the pull request

### Refactoring

Please implement the following refactors of the code:

1. Convert callback style code to use `async/await`
2. Reduce complexity at top level control flow logic and move logic down and test independently

#### Success Criteria

1. A pull request for each of the refactors above with:
    1. Code changes
    2. Tests
